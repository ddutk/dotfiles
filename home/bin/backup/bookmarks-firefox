# To get this script to work properly, you'll need to make sure that you've set the
# browser.bookmarks.autoExportHTML preference to true in about:config for Firefox >3.0,
# as that FF version doesn't write out bookmarks.html by default anymore.
#
# Also, all goes pear-shaped if you have more than one FF profile.

# This will be different on other operating systems
